                <p class="intro">Dogs can make good pets in Tunisia if they match your IifestyIe.Although most dogs
                    differ in attributes, dogs are generally caracterized by their intelligence, compassion and loyalty.
                    Most dogs prefer living in a vast and spacious environment where they can play around and excercise
                    there are however types of dogs that can live in small apartments that still require some excercise
                    from time to time to keep them happy. Dogs are social animals, which means they hate to be alone,
                    so make sure if you're going to adopt a dog that you have the free time necessary to play with it
                    and not make it feel lonely. They are not called man's best friend for nothing.

                <p class="intro"> Cats can make good pets in Tunisia if they match your IifestyIe. Domestic Cats have
                    been intriguing companions for humans since ancient times. Worldwide, cats are even more popular
                    than dogs as pets. Sadly, huge numbers of cats are in need of adoption and care. A cat owner who no
                    longer wants the cat, or is no longer able to care for a cat, may drop the cat off at a shelter or
                    simply abandon it. Overcrowding in shelters, along with too few adoptive families for the cats,
                    leads to many wonderful pets having to be euthanized. Abandoned cats fend for themselves and breed
                    in the wild, forming colonies of feral cats. Feral cats have such a difficult existence that they
                    typically only live an average of two years, whereas domestic cats can live an average of twelve
                    years with proper care. Organizations exist that can catch and tame feral kittens, and then place
                    them in a home, but adult ferals can rarely be socialized to trust humans. Meanwhile, many
                    prospective cat owners choose to purchase a kitten from a pet store or breeder, and may not know
                    that even purebred cats and kittens are often available for adoption.</p>

                <p class="intro"> Rodents & Small Mammals can make good pets in Tunisia if they match your IifestyIe.
                    Rodents are small mammals with four sharp teeth they use to eat, gnaw wood, and defend themselves.
                    Several types of rodents are popular pets, such as chinchillas, hamsters, gerbils, and guinea pigs.
                    Even rats are kept as pets! Rodents are often purchased as gifts for children. Sadly, however, many
                    owners of rodent pets do not know how to care for them properly, and young children are often
                    unprepared for the responsibility of having a pet. Families may not approach the purchase of a
                    rodent with the same level of commitment they would have to a pet dog or cat. Mistakes can be made
                    regarding the genders of a pair of rodents, resulting in a litter of unexpected babies. Some owners
                    of rodents simply turn their pets loose when they get tired of them, which usually leads to the
                    death of the animals, since they are not adapted to life in the wild. Free to good home ads can
                    result in a rodent being used for snake food. There are some rodent rescue operations out there that
                    can receive discarded pets, but these places tend to become overloaded due to so many people getting
                    rid of their rodents. Please approach all decisions to get a pet with a long-term commitment, and
                    pursue adoption rather than buying a rodent from a pet store.</p>

            <div class="Horses">
                <p class="intro"> Horses can make good pets in Tunisia if they match your IifestyIe. Horses are
                    beautiful, romantic
                    animals that many people love. Sadly, however, horses are being neglected, abused, and abandoned at
                    an alarming rate. The reasons a horse would need to be rescued are quite varied. Some horse owners
                    in the Western U.S. have lost their homes and land to foreclosure, leaving nowhere for their horses
                    to go. These horses are sometimes abandoned in the plains and deserts, where they often die of slow
                    exposure. Droughts, rising food and fuel prices, and other economic pressures mean that some owners
                    can no longer afford to feed and care for their horses. Other horses are purchased by inexperienced
                    people for sentimental reasons or as gifts for children, but their owners are unprepared for the
                    ongoing expense and involvement of caring for the horses.</p>
